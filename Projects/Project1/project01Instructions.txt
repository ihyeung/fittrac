Project 01
Team Members: Eric Williams, Irene Yeung, Kayla Cresswell

Team Lead: Kayla
Design Lead: Eric
Test Lead: Irene


KAYLA: The team lead will direct the software development of the app and be the final arbiter on any decision making for writing code, and for the overall direction of the app. However, they must not overrule the design lead and test lead without a good reason, and any overruling must be documented.
-->The team lead will draw up the class diagram for the app, with input from the others. You can do this by hand or using any tool you want.

ERIC: The design lead will make design decisions: font sizes, icons, colors, UI layouts. They will be communicated to the team lead, who will then decide the software architecture required to implement this functionality.
-->The design lead will draw neat wireframe sketches of the layouts. You can do this by hand or with any tool you want. You must indicate margins, sizes of UI elements (even if just match_parent or wrap_content), colors, all on the wireframe sketches of the layouts. You are welcome to direct the other team members

IRENE: The test lead takes the lead in testing both at the class level and module level, and can direct the others to run specific tests that they don’t have time to do themselves.
-->The test lead will use the team lead’s class diagram to develop tests, both for classes and modules. The full team will then implement these unit tests as directed by the tester. The tests must be sketched/drawn as an overlay on the class diagram in a separate document.



I highly recommend iterating between each other for each module. I want you each to take brief notes of discussions when you meet. It is VITAL that you log any discoveries/decisions that lead to significant UI changes. You must also log any major bug discoveries and document this.
