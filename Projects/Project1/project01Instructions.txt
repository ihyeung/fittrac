Project 01
Team Members: Eric Williams, Irene Yeung, Kayla Cresswell

Team Lead: Kayla
Design Lead: Eric
Test Lead: Irene


KAYLA: The team lead will direct the software development of the app and be the final arbiter on any decision making for writing code, and for the overall direction of the app. However, they must not overrule the design lead and test lead without a good reason, and any overruling must be documented.
-->The team lead will draw up the class diagram for the app, with input from the others. You can do this by hand or using any tool you want.

ERIC: The design lead will make design decisions: font sizes, icons, colors, UI layouts. They will be communicated to the team lead, who will then decide the software architecture required to implement this functionality.
-->The design lead will draw neat wireframe sketches of the layouts. You can do this by hand or with any tool you want. You must indicate margins, sizes of UI elements (even if just match_parent or wrap_content), colors, all on the wireframe sketches of the layouts. You are welcome to direct the other team members

IRENE: The test lead takes the lead in testing both at the class level and module level, and can direct the others to run specific tests that they don’t have time to do themselves.
-->The test lead will use the team lead’s class diagram to develop tests, both for classes and modules. The full team will then implement these unit tests as directed by the tester. The tests must be sketched/drawn as an overlay on the class diagram in a separate document.



I highly recommend iterating between each other for each module. I want you each to take brief notes of discussions when you meet. It is VITAL that you log any discoveries/decisions that lead to significant UI changes. You must also log any major bug discoveries and document this.


///////----Next Steps----///////
1) Get the ProfileSummaryFrag to show data from the ProfileEntryFrag when Submit is clicked
2) Set up the Fitness Regimen Frag
  a)Need Ability to Change Fitness Goal in Fitness Regimen Frag
  b)Fitness Regimen Details: 
    Depending on where I am in my fitness regimen, I sometimes want to either lose weight, maintain my weight, or gain weight. I want the app to have a module that takes in my height and weight, asks me            whether I’m sedentary or active, estimates my BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate, the basic number of calories I need to survive), and then tells me how many calories I need to eat if I want to lose or gain x lbs a week, where x is a number I decide. If I say that I want to maintain weight, I want the app to tell me how many calories to eat to maintain that weight. I sometimes get overzealous, so I want you to warn me if I’m trying to lose or gain more than 2 lbs a week. I also want you to warn me if my requirements end up making me eat too few calories (<1200 for men, <1000 for women).

Enter: Height, Weight, Sendentary/Active, Option(Gain/Loose x pounds || Maintain Weight)
Show: BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate, the basic number of calories I need to survive), Number of calories to eat to reach goal, if calories are too few add a toast that says so <1200 men, <1000 women

3)BMI Calculation at "Tap of Button"
4)Hikes Near me for Google Maps
5)Date Entry Validation
6)Split height into two fields: feet, inches COMPLETE
7)Update toast to only pop up if there is no name entered in the ProfileEntryFrag (this is one of his conditions in the write up)

///////----Features We'd Like To Have----///////
1. Carousel for Height and Weight
